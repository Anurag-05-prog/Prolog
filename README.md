# PROLOG

## NOTE

Unequal sign in Prolog is a Backslash( \ ) followed by a equal ( = ) sign without any blank. However this way of writing unequal sign is getting ignored by markdown file that's why I did put a space between 
Backslash( \ ) and equal ( = ). Remove that space when coding.

## VIVA

Artificial Intelligence enables the machine to think and perform its task without any human intervention.

Weak AI - Focuses on one task and cannot perform beyond its limitations (common in our daily lives)

Strong AI - Can understand and learn any intellectual task that a human being can (researchers are striving to reach strong AI)

Super AI - Surpasses human intelligence and can perform any task better than a human (still a concept)

Benefits of AI - Reduces Human Error, gives unbiased decisions, automate task, etc

Disadvantages of AI - High cost, makes human lazy, emotionless, no creativity, etc

Prolog - Prolog is a logical and declarative programming language that is well-suited for developing logic-based artificial intelligence applications.

Logic Programming Languages: Programs are written as a set of logical assertions and rules.
Examples: Prolog.

While Prolog primarily falls under the logic programming category, it also exhibits characteristics of declarative programming, as programmers specify what should be accomplished rather than how to achieve it.

Facts are the properties of an object or relationship between objects

A rule in Prolog is a clause, normally with one or more variables in it.

A collection of facts and rules is called a knowledge base (or a database)

Prolog's pattern matching is called unification.

A cut(!) inside a rule will prevent Prolog from backtracking any predicates behind the cut.

The use of the anonymous variable is to fill in places, where anything is welcome
